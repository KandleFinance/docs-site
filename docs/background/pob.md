# Proof-of-Burn (PoB)

> “Burnt coins are mining rigs”

This was Iain Stewart's saying who introduced the concept of __Proof of Burn (PoB)__ 
as an alternative to Proof of Work (PoW) in 2012.
The process of mining in PoW consumes a lot of power as the
computation for releasing a new block in the blockchain requires
heavy data processing and high hardware performance.
A study shows that generating new blocks will take years in the
near future and could be impossible to make a decade from now,
considering the current hardware processing limitations and the
number of blocks already generated.

The PoB is an efficient energy consumption process since
generating new blocks doesn't rely on computing algorithms. The
concept implies burning tokens to gain the right of validating
transactions in the network. Validators are then rewarded with
tokens. So, the more the holder burns, the higher chances are to
stand as a network validator.

The destroyed tokens are sent to a burn address, aka eater address,
that has no private key to make sure that the captured tokens can
never be spent by anyone.

In the long term, the burning process favors the rarity of a
cryptocurrency which can raise its value in the market and reduce
inflation.

    **Our project is a remastered version of the PoB concept with a more
    accelerated and interesting rewarding process.**
