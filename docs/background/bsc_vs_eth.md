# Binance Chain vs Ethereum Chain

Releasing Bitcoin as the first blockchain in the crypto world opened
the path for several other blockchains and networks to stand as
competitors in the market.

Launched in 2015, Ethereum was a huge success for being the first
blockchain that includes smart contract capabilities which makes
developing decentralized apps (DApps) possible. However,
Ethereum faced big scalability issues, slow transactions and gas fees
were going very high in specific periods. These facts left room for
competitors and traders began to look for alternatives.

In 2020, Binance announced its own Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
platform called Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Having an Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM) and smart contract abilities, BSC was a
game-changer for developers and traders with faster transactions
and less gas fees.

The BSC network is clearly surging in popularity as the number of
transactions has reached 4 times the number of transactions in the
Ethereum network. Transaction fees in Ethereum are roughly 10
times more than its competitor BSC where the transaction costs just
a few cents.

Since the number of transactions is an essential metric for
succeeding this project, we are willing to deploy our first version of
smart contract in the Binance Smart Chain network. We see more
advantages and the needed tools for long-term project
sustainability. This does not exclude Ethereum from our roadmap as
we later plan to build a cross-chain bridge to benefit from both
networks.
