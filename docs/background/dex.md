# Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

The decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer exchange where
transactions are made directly between traders.

The DEX relies on self-executing paperless contracts, written in
code, called smart contracts. The smart contract explains the terms
of the agreement between the buyer and the seller without the
need of intermediators. Therefore, it significantly reduces the costs
of transactions.

Once saved in the blockchain, the terms of a smart contract are
immutable which improves the security of the trading process since
it’s impossible, in any case, to bypass the defined terms.

Using a DEX guarantees the privacy of traders, no private
information is requested and no Know Your Customer (KYC) process
is needed before trading. The KYC process, mainly used by
centralized exchanges (CEX), involves collecting traders’ personal
information such as government-issued documents, addresses,
names… As a matter of fact, DEXs attract a larger number of users
who like to stay anonymous in the network.
Adding to this, the DEXs reduce the risk of being hacked because
they do not control the trader funds. In case of a DEX security issue,
the funds of the trader remain safe.

In this project, we are willing to provide liquidity in DEXs to benefit
from the advantages presented above. A viewable and trustful
smart contract is the main way of succeeding this project along with
its users. This does not exclude CEX from our ecosystem as we also
plan, later, to provide liquidity in CEXs in order to grow faster and to
attract more users to our platform.
