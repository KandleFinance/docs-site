# Background

The blockchain is a distributed database which saves data and
transmits information between the nodes of the computer
network. This technology, distinguished by its transparency and
high security level, opened a large gate to cryptocurrency systems
and helped grow a financial decentralized world.

A blockchain collects sets of information in groups called blocks.
Depending on its capacity, each block is filled with information and
linked to the previous filled block. This process is forming the
blockchain and since itâ€™s immutable and decentralized, the data
saved cannot be changed and the process is irreversible.
In a cryptocurrency system, this fact helps in saving the network
transactions. These transactions are and will be recorded
permanently and are and will always be seeable to anyone.

In a classic process, only banks are capable of verifying a
transaction between a sender and a receiver. In case this
transaction fails for any technical reason and that no record was
held, the transaction can be simply lost. This could never happen
for a cryptocurrency transaction as every node in the network
validates that transaction and yet has a copy of it.

Infrastructure costs, slow transactions and high fees are major
problems that blockchain has solved today. The cryptocurrency
world is exponentially growing and soon will replace, once for all,
the old ways of transacting values.
