Kandle is a DeFi project which aims to build an interactive
platform that allows holders to get access to innovative
features. The basic approach of its ecosystem implies
participating in a pool **to get interesting rewards** that can go
up to **2x the holder's engaged tokens**. The collected rewards
are gathered from different sources (transactions, pool,
collectors)

Being able to [vote during pools](howitworks/pool_participation_process.md) gives the Kandlers the
possibility of **sharing extra rewards** already collected by the
Fuel collector. The sophisticated algorithm enhances the
security of the process by excluding top rewarded Kandlers
from `X` upcoming pools. This improves the holderâ€™s
experience and guarantees a circular top prize allocation
between holders.

The main purpose of triggering pools is to have a cyclic
burning event with various numbers of tokens to burn. This
efficient auto-burn process will help us prevent deflation
and ensure a great stability of the token price

The next steps are challenging and we are counting on our
community and their support to be able to go forward and
offer more and more interesting features. The [development process](roadmap.md)
 is already in progress and first outcomes are yet to
be published during the next months.
