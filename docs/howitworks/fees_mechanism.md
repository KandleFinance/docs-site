# Fees mechanism
The blockchain technology helped make transactions easier and traceable. In Kandle, generating rewards is mainly
based on the number of transactions made on the network. Sending or receiving Kandle tokens will result in creating
new rewarding blocks, called transaction fees. Those fees, originally deducted from the transaction value, are
accumulated in a blockchain wallet called Fees collector.

The percentage of transaction fees is an external parameter and will be updated progressively to maintain a balance
between the price and the value of the token.
