# Pool Participation Process
## Light a *Kandle*
The Kandle ecosystem is based on pools. During the pool, Kandlers will engage some of their tokens in search of a **good prize** that
can reach up to **2x the given amount** :gift:.

The engaged tokens are split into Ashes and Burns using respectively the *Ashes collector* and the *Burns collector*.

<!-- ## // TODO: Add diagram -->

At the end of the pool, the ashes will be used to compute the rewards to be shared between Kandlers where as the
burns will define the number of tokens to be burned and discarded forever from the total supply. The exclusion
process will be explained in the next sections.

<!-- ## // TODO: Add link to the exclustion process -->

## Vote to maximize the rewards
Some of the features will be managed by Kandlers through a voting process. 
The vote result, `number of voters / number of participants`, will be used at the end of the pool
to define the extra rewards that will be shared among participants.

!!! note

    The vote is only accessible for holders who participated in a pool.

The extra rewards are generally extracted from the *Fuel collector* with a max percentage **to guarantee a
continuous refuel of rewards in each pool**.
