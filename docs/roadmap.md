# Project Roadmap

The Kandle platform is currently focusing on the pool based
approach. As a first step, our goal is to have as many
users/holders as possible to interact with this tool. Knowing
the real-world challenges and users feedback will help us
identify the needs for the upcoming developments.

We are also open to interesting suggestions from our
community and all those possibilities will be studied
carefully by our team in terms of development process
duration, needed resources and project sustainability
impact.
