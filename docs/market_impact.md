# Market Impact

The cryptocurrency world is exponentially expanding and
the market is overwhelmed with projects of redundant
ideas. The lack of innovation makes it easier for interesting
projects to rise and to succeed among many others.
Kandle is an innovative project with its unique ecosystem
approach. A generously rewarding concept is always
seductive and attractive for crypto investors who seek great
opportunities and sustainable projects to invest in.

We tried to study closely the impact of the Kandle
ecosystem on its token price. Taken in consideration the
expected number of holders and the possible scenarios in
certain periods of time, our simulation algorithms offered us
the following variations of the token price:

The results are promising. **Kandle is preventing the deflation**
of its token through its well-studied approach and we are
eager to get as close as possible to these simulation results
after project deployment.
