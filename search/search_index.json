So, the more the holder burns, the higher chances are to stand as a network validator.

After identifying the final prize to be shared among participants, a sorting algorithm is invoked to rearrange the holders\u2019 addresses depending on the number of tokens engaged in that pool. This will help us determine easily the top rewarded Kandlers. The maximum rewards multiplier is a parameter defined in the smart contract that limits the number of rewarded tokens. Using this multiplier, we efficiently manage the distribution of the rewards among Kandlers and the resulting prize is proportional to the engaged number of tokens. The number of the top rewarded Kandlers is also a parameter defined in the smart contract. The top rewarded Kandlers will have a higher rewards multiplier whereas other rewarded Kandlers will have a lower multiplier that ensures a minimum satisfying prize at the end of the pool. Pool Exclusion: an anti-whale mechanism To prevent crypto whales from manipulating pools and from being always listed among top rewarded kandlers, we developed an anti-whale mechanism that implies an exclusion of top rewarded Kandlers from X next pools. The X parameter is also defined in the smart contract and can change upon a mutual discussion with our community of holders.","title":"Rewarding Process"}]}
